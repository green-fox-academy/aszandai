    <p class="title">Notable achievements</p>
    <p class="subtitle">Designed, built and piloted a custom pod racer. 32 BBY Boonta Eve Classic Race Champion.</p>
    <p>In my spare time at Wald’s Parts junk shop I designed and built a Class III open cockpit Podracer
        capable of 588 mph top speed. Went on to win the Boonta Eve Classic race in 32 BBY - first ever win by a
        human. Generated documented
        company revenue of over 59 wupiupi during the course of my enslavement.</p>

    <p class="subtitle">Oversight of DS1 and DS2 Orbital Battle Stations construction projects</p>
    <p>During my tenure as a Supreme Imperial Fleet Commander I was in charge of large capital construction
        projects for
        the Deep Space Fleet. Performed acceptance testing of the DS1 SuperLaser in 0 BBY by annihilating Alderaan -
        a
        terrestrial class planet in the Core Worlds region. Successfully tripled the deep space fire power of the
        imperial
        fleet in accordance with the Tarkin Doctrine before losing both projects to run-away photon
        torpedoes.</p>
